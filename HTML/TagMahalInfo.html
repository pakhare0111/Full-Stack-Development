<pre>    The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile 
    Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des Établissements 
    Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the 
    proposed <mark>1889</mark> Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the 
    centennial of the French Revolution. 
In <mark>May 1884</mark>, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by 
him as "a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the 
base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals".
[10] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, 
and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's <abbr title="architectural department"><b>AD</b></abbr>, 
to contribute to the design. 
Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to 
the first level, and other embellishments.[citation needed]</p>
